- Redo the plots
- Talk to Max about how many data points should be plotted
- Create separate output directories for different flows
- Read about hyper-parameter search. Ask Max if Grid search in scikit learn can be used.

TODO: 01-Aug-2017
- Radial flows: alphas are positive. Initialize alphas using a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. 
Ask Max if this can ensure positive alphas.  
- Handle the case of numFlow=0. Define sum_logdet_jacobian as a tensorflow variable.
